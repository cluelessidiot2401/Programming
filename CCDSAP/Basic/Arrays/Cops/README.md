# Cops and the Thief Devu 

There are 100 houses located on a straight line. The first house is numbered 1 and the last one is numbered 100. Some M houses out of these 100 are occupied by cops.

Thief Devu has just stolen PeePee's bag and is looking for a house to hide in.

PeePee uses fast 4G Internet and sends the message to all the cops that a thief named Devu has just stolen her bag and ran into some house.
